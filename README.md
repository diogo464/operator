# labels
// TODO(user): Add simple overview of use/purpose

## ingress

Some annotations are provided for ingresses:
```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    # enable/disable a public ingress.
    # enabling this will create a second ingress that exposes the service to the public.
    infra.d464.sh/ingress-public: "true"
    # enabling this will force the connections to use ssl
    infra.d464.sh/ingress-force-ssl: "true"
```

## MinioServiceAccount

This resource represents a service account in minio.
It will create a secret with the credentials used to access minio.

```yaml
version: infra.d464.sh/v1
kind: MinioServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: mads
spec:
  buckets: [mads]
```

The generate secret will look like:
```yaml
version: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mads-minio
data:
  S3_URL: http://minio.storage.svc.cluster.local:9000
  S3_ACCESS_KEY: <access key>
  S3_SECRET_KEY: <secret key>
```


## Description

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.20.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/labels:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified. 
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment. 
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/labels:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin 
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
